# 🎭 Real-Time Face and Emotion Detection using OpenCV, Mediapipe & DeepFace

This project demonstrates **real-time face detection** and **emotion recognition** using a webcam. It leverages powerful libraries like **OpenCV**, **MediaPipe**, and **DeepFace** to analyze facial features and detect the user's dominant emotion live.

## 📸 Features

- 🧠 Real-time **Face Mesh Detection** using MediaPipe
- 😊 Live **Emotion Recognition** using DeepFace
- 🖥️ Works with webcam feed
- 🚀 Lightweight and fast
- 💡 Easy to set up and run

📌 Notes
	•	Ensure your webcam is working and accessible.
	•	DeepFace may take a moment to analyze frames.
	•	The emotion detection supports emotions like: happy, sad, angry, neutral, etc.

 🧠 Future Improvements
	•	Add gender and age detection
	•	Store logs or emotion history
	•	Deploy to a web app using Streamlit or Flask
